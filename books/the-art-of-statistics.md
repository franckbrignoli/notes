# The Art of Statistics



We need data literacy to be able to do:

* stats analysis on real world problem
* understand and critique conclusions drawn by others on the basis of stats

### Getting Things in Proportion

* Framing positively/negatively has an emotional impact \(ex: 95% success or 5% failure\)
* using relative risk is misleading \(ex: 18% more than the other group\) clarify with absolute risk
* Communicate risks with expected frequencies to improve understanding - _what does it means for 100 person?_
