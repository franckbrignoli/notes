# The Art of Statistics



We need data literacy to be able to do:

* stats analysis on real world problem
* understand and critique conclusions drawn by others on the basis of stats

### Getting Things in Proportion

* Framing positively/negatively has an emotional impact \(ex: 95% success or 5% failure\)
* using relative risk is misleading \(ex: 18% more than the other group\) clarify by using absolute risk
* Communicate risks with expected frequencies to improve understanding - _what does it means for 100 person?_

### Summarizing and Communicating Numbers, Lots of Numbers

* Wisdom of crowds - averaging multiple estimates
* Visualization - use logarithmic scales to reduce the impact of extreme values
* Mean/Mode/Median 
* Describe the spread with 
  * Range
  * Inter-quartile range - difference between 75th and 25th percentile
  * Standard deviation
* Describe relation between variables
  * Pearson correlation coefficient
  * Spearman's rank correlation

### Why Are We Looking At Data Anyway

* [Deduction vs Induction](https://socialresearchmethods.net/kb/dedind.php)
  * Deduction \(or top-down\): Theory &gt; Hypothesis &gt; Observation &gt; Confirmation
  * Induction \(bottom-up\): Observation &gt; Pattern &gt; Tentative Hypothesis &gt; Theory

\(1\) Data &gt; \(2\) Sample &gt; \(3\) Study Population &gt; \(4\) Target Population

### What Causes What?

X causes Y **doesn't means** that everytime X occurs Y will too.   
Or that Y only occurs when X.  
=&gt; If we force X then Y will occurs more often

### Modeling Relationships Using Regression

* Statistical Model
  * Representation of the relationships between variables that can be used to explain or predict.
  * Composed of
    * Mathematical Formula used to explain or predict
    * Residual Error: Difference between what happen and what has been predicted

### Algorithms, Analytics And Prediction
