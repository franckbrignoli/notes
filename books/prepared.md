# Prepared

### Project Based Learning

* Learning with a project = higher understanding, memorization and more fun
  * Kids learning with projects are better problem solver & critical thinker
* Link project to real world problem
  * Projects start with a problem, question or challenge that is relevant to the student life and community 
* Textbooks are made as clear as possible
  * but it doesn't ask the kids to think deeply, make connections or solve problems

### Self Direction

* Help them define SMART goals
* 5 behaviors
  * Strategy shifting
  * Challenged seeking
  * Persistence
  * Respondings to setback
  * Appropriate help seeking
* The progress of the class is not the progress of the student
* To help your child to learn something new. Sit next to him to answer his questions and avoid supervising by doing a different activity for yourself.
* Priotize your kid learning/development over your comfort
* Feedback mechanism are important
* As parent we like being needed by our child = conflict for the child autonomy

### Mentoring

* Kids with at least one meaningful relation with an adult at school have better outcomes
* Ask questions to provoke the mentee to reflect on what they want, who they are, how they feel ...
  * Use open ended questions 
  * Help kids to find what they like and what is unique for them by asking them to use "ings"
  * Make them switch perspective
* They must learn the practice of reflection
  * help them to identify the outcome they want, the plan they made and what is blocking them
  * clear expectation make it easier to give

### Collaboration

* Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing
  * Use tools to ease these steps:
    * booklet of shared expectations
    * decision grid \(who will decide, veto, input proposal...\)
      * no one want to make all the decisions they just want to make the decision important to them
    * STP \(Status, Target, Proposal\)
