Project Based Learning

* Learning with a project = higher understanding, memorization and more fun
  * Kids learning with projects are better problem solver & critical thinker
* Link project to real world problem
  * Projects start with a problem, question or challenge that is relevant to the student life and community 
* Textbooks are made as clear as possible
  * but it doesn't ask the kids to think deeply, make connections or solve problems
