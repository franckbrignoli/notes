# Prepared

### Project Based Learning

* Learning with a project = higher understanding, memorization and more fun
  * Kids learning with projects are better problem solver & critical thinker
* Link project to real world problem
  * Projects start with a problem, question or challenge that is relevant to the student life and community 
* Textbooks are made as clear as possible
  * but it doesn't ask the kids to think deeply, make connections or solve problems

### Self Direction

* Help them define smart goals
* 5 behaviors
  * Strategy shifting
  * Challenged seeking
  * Persistence
  * Respondings to setback
  * Appropriate help seeking
* The progress of the class is not the progress of the student
* To help your child to learn something new. Sit next to him to answer his questions and avoid supervising by doing a different activity for yourself.
* Priotize your kid learning/development over your comfort
* Feedback mechanism are important
* As parent we like being needed by our child = conflict for the child autonomy
