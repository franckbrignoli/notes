* That’s what happened to Andy at Harvard: by asking, “How am I supposed to do that?” I influenced his System 1 emotional mind into accepting that his offer wasn’t good enough; his System 2 then rationalized the situation so that it made sense to give me a better offer.
* The less important he makes himself, the more important he probably is \(and vice versa\).
* Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen attentively.
* we can process only about seven pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment.
* Instead of prioritizing your argument—in fact, instead of doing any thinking at all in the early goings about what you’re going to say—make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.
* The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need \(monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise\) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want.
* But neither wants nor needs are where we start; it begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin.
* The problem was, we were in too much of a hurry, driving too hard toward a quick solution; trying to be a problem solver, not a people mover.
* Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard and we risk undermining the rapport and trust we’ve built.
* my Late-Night, FM DJ Voice: deep, soft, slow, and reassuring.
* people tend to focus all their energies on what to say or do, but it’s how we are \(our general demeanor and delivery\) that is both the easiest thing to enact and the most immediately effective mode of influence.
* Our brains don’t just process and understand the actions and words of others but their feelings and intentions too,
* That’s why your most powerful tool in any verbal communication is your voice.
* the late-night FM DJ voice, the positive/playful voice, and the direct or assertive voice.
* Most of the time, you should be using the positive/playful voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you’re talking. A smile, even while talking on the phone, has an impact tonally that the other person will pick up on.
* When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve \(instead of fight and resist\). It applies to the smile-er as much as to the smile-ee: a smile on your face, and in your voice, will increase your own mental agility.
* when you inflect your voice in a downward way, you put it out there that you’ve got it covered. Talking slowly and clearly you convey one idea: I’m in control. When you inflect in an upward way, you invite a response. Why? Because you’ve brought in a measure of uncertainty. You’ve made a statement sound like a question.
* driver of the getaway car. Mirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation. It’s another neurobehavior humans \(and other animals\) display in which we copy each other to comfort each other. It can be done with speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice. It’s generally an unconscious behavior—we are rarely aware of it when it’s happening—but it’s a sign that people are bonding, in sync, and establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust.
* We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar.
* being right isn’t the key to a successful negotiation—having the right mindset is.
* If you take a pit bull approach with another pit bull, you generally end up with a messy scene and lots of bruised feelings and resentment. Luckily, there’s another way without all the mess.
* The intention behind most mirrors should be “Please, help me understand.” Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they’ve said.
* Ask someone, “What do you mean by that?” and you’re likely to incite irritation or defensiveness. A mirror, however, will get you the clarity you want while signaling respect and concern for what the other person is saying.
* Getting to this level of emotional intelligence demands opening up your senses, talking less, and listening more.
* Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow.
* We spotted their feelings, turned them into words, and then very calmly and respectfully repeated their emotions back to them.
* Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it. Give someone’s emotion a name and you show you identify with how that person feels.
* when people are shown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greater activity in the amygdala, the part that generates fear. But when they are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that govern rational thinking. In other words, labeling an emotion—applying rational words to a fear—disrupts its raw intensity.
* wealth of information from the other person’s words, tone, and body language. We call that trinity “words, music, and dance.” The trick to spotting feelings is to pay close attention to changes people undergo when they respond to external events.
* Notice we said “It sounds like . . .” and not “I’m hearing that . . .” That’s because the word “I” gets people’s guard up. When you say “I,” it says you’re more interested in yourself than the other person, and it makes you take personal responsibility for the words that follow—and the offense they might cause.
* The last rule of labeling is silence. Once you’ve thrown out a label, be quiet and listen.
* people’s emotions have two levels: the “presenting” behavior is the part above the surface you can see and hear; beneath, the “underlying” feeling is what motivates the behavior.
* good negotiators do when labeling is address those underlying emotions.
* Labeling negatives diffuses them \(or defuses them, in extreme cases\); labeling positives reinforces them.
* Research shows that the best way to deal with negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgment. Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, and solution-based thoughts.
* Well, the faster we can interrupt the amygdala’s reaction to real or imaginary threats, the faster we can clear the road of obstacles, and the quicker we can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust.
* That’s why I went right at the amygdala
* Many of us wear fears upon fears, like layers against the cold, so getting to safety takes time.
* The first step of doing so is listing every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you, in what I call an accusation audit.
* “No” is pure gold. That negative provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don’t want. “No” is a safe choice that maintains the status quo; it provides a temporary oasis of control.
* “No” is often a decision, frequently temporary, to maintain the status quo. Change is scary, and “No” provides a little protection from that scariness.
* When someone tells you “No,” you need to rethink the word in one of its alternative—and much more real—meanings:
* everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges: the need to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control.
* Saying “No” gives the speaker the feeling of safety, security, and control. You use a question that prompts a “No” answer, and your counterpart feels that by turning you down he has proved that he’s in the driver’s seat.
* Behavioral Change Stairway Model \(BCSM\). The model proposes five stages—active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, and behavioral change—that take any negotiator from listening to influencing behavior.
* I wrote a two-page document that instructed Benjie to change course. We were going to use nearly every tactic in the active listening arsenal:
* answer—“ You’re right.” He agreed, in theory, but he didn’t own the conclusion.
* Time is one of the most crucial variables in any negotiation. The simple passing of time and its sharper cousin, the deadline, are the screw that pressures every deal to a conclusion.
* it can trick you into believing that doing a deal now is more important than getting a good deal.
* Ask yourself: What is it about a deadline that causes pressure and anxiety? The answer is consequences;
* When people issue threats, they consciously or subconsciously create ambiguities and loopholes they fully intend to exploit.
* Now, knowing how negotiators use their counterpart’s deadlines to gain leverage would seem to suggest that it’s best to keep your own deadlines secret.
* Moore discovered that when negotiators tell their counterparts about their deadline, they get better deals. It’s true. First, by revealing your cutoff you reduce the risk of impasse. And second, when an opponent knows your deadline, he’ll get to the real deal- and concession-making more quickly.
* Studying people who had damage in the part of the brain where emotions are generated, he found that they all had something peculiar in common: They couldn’t make decisions. They could describe what they should do in logical terms, but they found it impossible to make even the simplest choice. In other words, while we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision making is governed by emotion.
* If you find yourself in this situation, the best reaction is to simply mirror the “F” that has just been lobbed at you. “Fair?” you’d respond, pausing to let the word’s power do to them as it was intended to do to you. Follow that with a label: “It seems like you’re ready to provide the evidence that supports that,”
* “I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I’m being unfair, and we’ll address it.”
* Become a Rainmaker,
* If you can get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and unmet objectives—if you can get at what people are really buying—then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution.
* What I am saying is that while our decisions may be largely irrational, that doesn’t mean there aren’t consistent patterns, principles, and rules behind how we act. And once you know those mental patterns, you start to see ways to influence them.
* The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. That’s called the Certainty Effect. And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That’s called Loss Aversion.
* To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.
* So start out with an accusation audit acknowledging all of their fears. By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other side’s loss aversion so that they’ll jump at the chance to avoid it.
* That’s why I suggest you let the other side anchor monetary negotiations.
* The real issue is that neither side has perfect information going to the table. This often means you don’t know enough to open with confidence.
* he’s going to go for an extreme anchor in order to bend your reality.
* After you’ve anchored them high, you can make your offer seem reasonable by offering things that aren’t important to you but could be important to them. Or if their offer is low you could ask for things that matter more to you than them.
* numbers that end in 0 inevitably feel like temporary placeholders,
* His new price? $7,500. In response, we had the cousin “spontaneously” say he’d throw in a new portable CD stereo and repeated the $4,751. The kidnappers, who didn’t really want the CD stereo felt there was no more money to be had, said yes.
* learned that negotiation was coaxing, not overcoming; co-opting, not defeating. Most important, we learned that successful negotiation involved getting your counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your solution himself. It involved giving him the illusion of control while you, in fact, were the one defining the conversation.
* Instead of asking some closed-ended question with a single correct answer, he’d asked an open-ended, yet calibrated one that forced the other guy to pause and actually think about how to solve the problem.
* “Why did you do it?” can be calibrated to “What caused you to do it?”
* “Yes” is nothing without “How.”
* A gentle How/No invites collaboration and leaves your counterpart with a feeling of having been treated with respect.
* That is, only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face.
* When someone’s tone of voice or body language does not align with the meaning of the words they say, use labels to discover the source of the incongruence.
* The Rule of Three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation.
* The first time they agree to something or give you a commitment, that’s No. 1. For No. 2 you might label or summarize what they said so they answer, “That’s right.” And No. 3 could be a calibrated “How” or “What” question about implementation that asks them to explain what will constitute success, something like “What do we do if we get off track?”
* Just as using Alastair’s name with the kidnapper and getting him to use it back humanized the hostage and made it less likely he would be harmed, using your own name creates the dynamic of “forced empathy.” It makes the other side see you as a person.
* fall into three broad categories. Some people are Accommodators; others—like me—are basically Assertive; and the rest are data-loving Analysts.
* To be good, you have to learn to be yourself at the bargaining table. To be great you have to add to your strengths, not replace them.
* don’t treat others the way you want to be treated; treat them the way they need to be treated.
* First, deflect the punch in a way that opens up your counterpart. Successful negotiators often say “No” in one of the many ways we’ve talked about \(“How am I supposed to accept that?”\) or deflect the anchor with questions like “What are we trying to accomplish here?” Responses like these are great ways to refocus your counterpart when you feel you’re being pulled into the compromise trap.
* you can detour the conversation to the non monetary issues that make any final price work.
* Instead of naming a price, allude to an incredibly high number that someone else might charge.
* And so when someone puts out a ridiculous offer, one that really pisses you off, take a deep breath, allow little anger, and channel it—at the proposal, not the person—and say, “I don’t see how that would ever work.”
* “Why would you ever do business with me? Why would you ever change from your existing supplier? They’re great!” In these questions, the “Why?” coaxes your counterpart into working for you.
* maintain a collaborative relationship even when you’re setting boundaries. Your response must always be expressed in the form of strong, yet empathic, limit-setting boundaries—that is, tough love—not
