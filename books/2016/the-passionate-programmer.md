# The Passionate Programmer

### Notes

* Choosing your market
  * career by coincidence: the company decide of the tech and you follow
  * choose technology you want to invest in
  * lead or bleed
    * very old vs new/incoming tech, both seems viable
    * **build a technology radar** 
      * remind me of [https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)
  * supply & demand
    * some techno with high demand will make you compete against tons of people \(offshore\)
      * compete on market with low demand
      * on the other hand lower price will create more demand and still some onshore developer will be needed
  * If you want to be relevant dive into the domain you are in
    * **buy magazin of your industry**
    * **eat with the salesperson of your company**
  * Be the worst
    * people can significantly improve or regress in skill purely based on who they are performing with
  * Invest in your intelligence
    * "Java programmers aren't as smart as Python programmers"
      * Not related directly to the language, but people learning x may be more curious \(where x is a bit exotic\)
      * Remind me the interview Scala guys vs PHP

    * Learn about the complete stack and "generalize" your speciality
    * Don't limit yourself to tech skills
      * learn business
      * soft skills

    * "Too many of us seem to believe that specializing in something simply means you don't know about others things"
    * If you pretend to be a specialist, you needs to know everything about a topic
  * Do not invest in one specific technology
* Invest in your market
