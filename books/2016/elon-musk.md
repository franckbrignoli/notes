# Elon Musk

* Bright mind are currently working on non important problems
* We've grown fucking soft,
  * \(people not working during the weekend\)
* The most important is to ask to the correct question, the answer is the easy part
* don't go to a meeting with bad news and no alternative plans
  * you don't tell Elon that you can't do something
* the longer you wait to fire someone the longer it has been since you should have fired them
* Bringing startup spirit to old domain
  * young guy, smart & work hard
  * Mostly leans startups: fail fast & try something new
* Some struggles with contractor, delay, not using the A team for a small company
* Capacity to absorb 90% of the knowledge of someone
* Make important decision fast
* Capacity to endure very high amount of stress 
* Either you try to make something spectacular with no compromises or you're not
