Base Rate Neglect -  ??

**Scope Insensitivity/neglect**   
Exponential increass in scope create linear increases in willingness to pay  
  
**Availability Bias**   
Judging the frequency/probability of an event by the ease with which examples of the event come to mind.  
  
**Absurbity bias**  
Events that has never occurs are deemed with a probability of 0.  
A society facing regular hazards treat these events as the maximum risks.

**Cognitive Bias**  
Obstacles to truth due to the universal human machinery \(not based on the amount of knowledge or cultural background\).  
  
**Conjunction Fallacy**  
Assigning Probability A and B &gt; Probability A or B.  
****Adding more detail make it sound more plausible even though it become less probable

**Planning Falacy**   
We are bad at planning. When asked for a realistic scenario, we envision everything going as exactly as planned \(= best case scenario\).  
  
Use the outside view to avoid thinking about the unique features of a project and just ask yourself how long it took to finish a similar project in the past.

**Foudational Skill**: The ability to spot psychological signs that you have or not, a mental map of something

The rationalist virtue of empiricism consists of **constantly asking which experience our beliefs predict or prohibit.** If you believe X what do you expect to see happen because of X

**If you argue, which difference of anticipation are you arguing about?** Don't ask what to believe but what to anticipate.

**Pretending to be Wise**: trying to signal wisdom by refusing to make guesses, to sum up evidence, to take side.

**Choosing neutrality is just as attackable as any particular side**. \(Additionally, choosing neutrality can encourage the dominant side\).

**Hindsight bias**: the tendency to perceive events that has already occured as having been more predictable than they were before the event took place

**A clear argument has to start from what an audience already knows or accepts.**

At school we have learnt to answer with keywords to have a good grade without a real understanding behind the keywords \(**guessing the teacher password**\). This learned behaviour is still very active in our daily life.

**Beware of semantic stopsign**, it is a curiousity blocker and prevent us to consider the next question:  
- Where does this laws of physics come from?  
- God!   
  
**Go head first and confront the mysterious part directly \(learning\).**

We usually try to find positive examples to determine a rule but you have to search for negative example to define it \(ex: 2-4-6 rule\)
