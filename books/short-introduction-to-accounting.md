# Short Introduction to Accounting

### History

#### T-Account

* One cross for one account
  * Debit \(="he owes"\) on the left
    * Historically the left side as a negative connotation
      * "Gauche" / "Sinister"
      * In the bible, bad guys go on Jesus' left
  * Credit \(="he trusts"\) on the right
* No signs because they were not invented yet
* Numbers are not crossed to prevent allegations of fraud

#### Double Entry

* Business are growing 
  * Partners/collaborators are not immediate members of the family \(so they cannot be fully trusted\).
  * Profits needs to be calculated in order to be shared between partners
  * Cash and inventory are larger
* Now everything can be seen as double entry
  * "The owner A gives 100 to the cashier"
