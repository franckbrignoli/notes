# The Stoic Challenge

* Setbacks are composed by 2 parts
  * the obstacle
  * the emotion

    > what upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about the things
* Setbacks are tests created by the "stoic gods"

  * To pass you must find a workaround for the obstacle and avoid the negative emotion
  * Not to punish us but to give us an opportunity to grow

* Stoic adventures
  * put yourself into challenging situations
    * tackle your fears
  * the hero's journey
    * call to adventure

      * refuse =&gt; person remains the same
      * accept =&gt; person returns transformed
* Methods
  * Anchoring
    * Imagine how your life can be worst to enjoy what you have
  * Framing
    * By default we tend to use the "blame frame" to explain setbacks.
    * Consciously we can change the frame to prevent the negative emotions to be triggered: competing, incompetence, game, challenge...
  * 5 sec rules - when a setback occurs you have 5 sec to declare it as a "stoic challenge"

> When mind and body have been corrupted by pleasure, nothings seems bearable - not because the thinigs which you suffer are hard, but because you are soft.
