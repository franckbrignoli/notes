# It's Okay to Be the Boss

by Bruce Tulgan

* Nearly all the relevant research indicates that people are actually motivated by both internal and external factors.
* Responsibility without sufficient direction and support is not empowerment. It is downright negligent.
* in leadership positions simply must take charge of their people: give orders, track performance, correct failure, and reward success, every step of the way. These are just the basics of managing people, and anything less is undermanagement.
* Employment is a transactional relationship, just like a customer relationship. Those whom you manage are being paid to do the job. That is the ultimate source of your authority, plain and simple. No hard feelings.
* Our research shows that the primary reason why so many management conversations are so very difficult is precisely because they are so rare. When management conversations happen only on special occasions, they tend to be very difficult.
* “nice guy” into “tough guy” on a dime, then there is a good chance you will seem like a jerk. Not only that, but people are not likely to take you seriously. They might think that you can’t or won’t enforce your new pronouncements…or will ultimately cool off and forget about the whole thing.
* when a manager avoids spending time up front in advance making sure things go right, things always go wrong.
* Effective managing is a lot like being in good physical shape: the hard part is getting in the habit of doing it every day no matter what obstacles come up. So stop letting yourself off the hook. Stay in touch with your true priorities. Make yourself do it every day, as if your health depended on it.
* If you do all of your rapport building with employees by talking about personal matters as if you are personal friends, then, when the conversation turns serious—as it always does—you have to adopt a whole different personality. You go from being Mr. Nice Guy Friend to Mr. Jerk Boss,
* The problem is that Mr. Friend starts feeling like a fake and Mr. Boss struggles for legitimacy.
* “Nobody can learn karate in a day or a year. All we have is today. What can I teach you right now? What can you focus on right now? What can you improve right now? The only thing that matters is what we are doing here right now.”
* The time to coach an employee is in advance so you can set her up for success.
* Who is this person at work? Why do I need to manage this person? What do I need to talk about with this person? How should I talk with this person? Where should I talk with this person? When should I talk with this person?
* Every employee is a special case. If you don’t know what makes one of your employees a special case, you better find out. Keep asking yourself: “Who is this person at work?” Assess each employee’s basic strengths and weaknesses. Consider the role each person plays in your workplace. Know how issues at home bear on an employee’s role at work. Manage the self each employee brings to work.
* don’t make the mistake of thinking that some are so talented, skilled, and motivated that you don’t need to manage them at all.
* Clarify your goals with each person. What do you need from this person? Keep in mind what might go wrong if you don’t manage this person. Pay attention: The reasons for managing each person will change over time.
* “What do I need to talk about today?”
* Talk about the work. Focus on what you want the employee to do in the immediate future. Decide whether you should talk about the big picture or all the minor details. For some employees, breaking things down and spelling them out can make the difference between high performance and low performance.
* Think about what motivates this person. Figure out what tone and style work best. Most employees respond best to verbal communication supported by visual aids in writing. Choose the right communication tools and techniques for each person.
* Spell out expectations in advance in vivid terms. Track employee performance every step of the way. Follow through with real consequences based on whether the employee’s actual performance meets those expectations or not.
* your number one responsibility is to make absolutely sure that every person you manage understands exactly what he is expected to do and exactly how he is expected to do it.
* Trial and error is a good way of solving a new problem; it is not a good way of learning best practices.
* I believe as a manager you have to ‘follow up, follow up, follow up.’ That’s how you get results.”
* If an employee’s job is to be creative, the biggest favor you can do for that employee is to be clear about what is not within the employee’s discretion. Spell out the parameters within which the employee ought to operate.
* Create a script so you stay on track during the conversation. Anticipate any excuses the employee typically offers you for failing to improve performance.
* Low performers send a terrible message to everybody else: “Low performance is an option around here.” No way.
