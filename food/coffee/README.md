### Processing

#### Natural Process

* Unripe cherries are removed
* Remaining ones are spread out on a brick patio or raised drying tables to dry them under the sun. 
* They are turned regularly to prevent rotting 
* Once dry the skin and fruit are removed mechanically

Natural processing may add a fruity taste like: blueberry, strawberry or tropical fruits. But sometimes add a negative like barnyard, wild, ferment and manure.

#### Washed Process

* Unripe cherries are removed
* The skin and fruit flesh are removed
* Washed and fermented to removed leftovers
* Dried under the sun on brick patio/drying tables

The result will generaly have a higher level of acidity, increased complexity and feeling of "cleaner cup"
