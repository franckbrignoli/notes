# V60

### Brewing

**Prepare the v60.** Add the paper filter and rinse it with hot water: That will remove the paper taste and pre-warm the pot.

**Prepare the coffee**. Medium grind. Ratio: 1:17-15. Pour it into the paper filter and create a well in the middle. That will help during the 1st phase to saturate the coffee evenly.

**Phase 1 - Bloom**. Pour 2 to 3 time the coffee dose as water and give it a decent swirl and let it bloom for 30/45 sec max. The goal is to wet all the coffee with a little bit of water. That will release the carbon dioxyd and help with the extraction. 

**Phase 2 - Pouring Time.** Add 60% of the total water in 60 seconds. The coffee bed needs to be disturbed a little bit, so do not pour the water too gently or too hard. The cone should be "full" that will keep the temperature high \(critical\).

**Phase 3 - Final Pour**. Keep the water topped up by pourring the rest of the water gently \(30sec\). Swirl gently in one direction and then in the opposite direction to remove the grain stuck in the side of the filter. Once the water as drained a little bit give it a last swirl.
