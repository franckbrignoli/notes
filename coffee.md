# Moka Pot

### Brewing

**Boil your water** in a kettle and not directly in the moka pot. That's a way to prevent the coffee from heating too much and delivering a bitter taste.

**Prepare the coffee.** Grind it finely but a little bit than Espresso. Pour it into the basket, shake it gently to spread and flatten the coffee. DO NOT tamp it - due to the lack of pressure, the water would flow too slowly and the coffee extraction would too slow.

**Start brewing.** Put your pot on the stove on a medium/low heat and keep the lid open to control the flow. A dark coffee should start flowing slowly.

**Turn off the heat** when the coffee start to be blond and bubbling. Theurn off the extraction by running the bottom of the mokapot under the water. 

**Enjoy your coffee!**
