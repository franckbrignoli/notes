### How To Use A Moka Pot

* Boil the water in a kettle 
* Fill the basket with fine grounded coffee \(coarser than Espresso\). Shake it a little to flatten the coffee but DO NOT tamp it.
* Pour the boiling water in the reservoir, just below the valve.
* Assemble the moka pot, leave the lid open and put it on the stove on low heat.
* The coffee will start to flow out. Pay attention and turn off the heat as soon as the flow accelerate
