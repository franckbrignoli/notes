# Tracking Glucose



* Why should I track my Glucose?
* How can I do it?
* What is a decent range? What about longevity?
* Is the glycemic response to 1 aliment always similar? does it vary based on the context \(ex: sugar after protein\)
* What happen to the blood glucose during/after a workout?
* I have noticed an increase of my blood glucose while watching a cooking channel on YT, is there any relation?
* Why is my blood glucose going below my "baseline" after a meal?
