# Tracking Glucose



* Why should I track my Glucose?

The glycemic response is very personal. 

### Levels Recommendation

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Level</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Values</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Prepandial (fasting)</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>55 - 100 mg/dl</p>
        <p>(<a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2011/1/glucose-the-silent-killer">or &lt; 80 mg/dl</a>)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Postpandial (in the 2h following a meal)</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>&lt; 140 mg/dl</p>
        <p>(<a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2011/1/glucose-the-silent-killer">or baseline + 40</a>)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>Aiming for a daily average of 90 with +/- 20 variance seems like the way to go.

### Protocol

* Define your baseline by measuring your glucose level in the morning before eating/drinking anything \(fasting glucose\)
* Before eating verify that you are within the 20mg/dl of your baseline
* Eat the food that you want to test and measure every 30min until you are back within the 20mg/dl zone of your baseline \(roughly 2 hours\)

### Open Questions

* Is the glycemic response to 1 aliment always similar? does it vary based on the context \(ex: sugar after protein\)
* What happen to the blood glucose during/after a workout?
* I have noticed an increase of my blood glucose while watching a cooking channel on YT, is there any relation?
* Why is my blood glucose going below my "baseline" after a meal?
