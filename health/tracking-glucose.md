# Tracking Glucose

To track continuously my glucose I use the [Abbott Freestyle Libre 2](https://www.freestylelibre.de/libre/freestylelibre2.html).

### Goals

* Understand how food/fasting/exercise influence my blood glucose
* Optimise my diet accordingly

### Protocol

* Define your baseline by measuring your glucose level in the morning before eating/drinking anything \(fasting glucose\)
* Before eating verify that you are within the 20mg/dl of your baseline
* Eat the food that you want to test and measure every 30min until you are back within the 20mg/dl zone of your baseline \(roughly 2 hours\)

### Food

* Oats
* Rice
* Ice cream
* Eggs & Bacon
